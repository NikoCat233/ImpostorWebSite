    <h2>
      [Imposter Anticheat+] Server cannot auth you. Try disable your http proxy!
    </h2>
    <p>
      For friendcode and puid stuffs to work, we force-require players to join
      our server with a same ip from the one it used in http requests. <br />
	    You need to either disable your proxy, or make sure your proxy full-route your
      traffic to our server. <br />
	    For some phone players, it may be useful for 
      you to toggle on "Flight mode" and off and retry join the server.
    </p>

    <h2>Vanilla DuplicateConnectionDetected</h2>
    <p>
      If you (or your friend) use different accounts to join our server from a same network, 
      you will get this.<br />
      We assign friendcodes and auth details based on your ip. We are unable to
      deal with the cases where "2 alts join from a single IP"<br />
      Sorry for any inconvenience caused.
    </p>

    <h2>[Impostor AntiCheat+] Host didn't spawn you in time</h2>
    <p>
      This is because the host failed to spawn your role in 3 seconds.
      <br />This process is completely managed by host. If host or server is too
      laggy, this might happen. <br />Try rejoin first, ask your host for help
      then, and finally report issues to NikoCat233.
    </p>

    <h2>[Impostor Anticheat+] Too many clients from a same ip.</h2>
    <p>
      This is because our server limits you to only have 2 online clients from a
      same network.
    </p>

    <h2>[Impostor Anticheat+] Too many clients from a same puid.</h2>
    <p>
      Similar from above one but it's because you try to join the server with a
      same AU account.
    </p>

    <h2>[Impostor Anticheat+] You are banned by EAC previously.<br />Or Vanilla Cheating/Hacking (2114-5-14)</h2>
    <p>
      You are banned by TOHE EAC.
      Appeal at discord.gg/tohe
    </p>

    <h2>[Imposter AntiCheat+] You are kicked because of cheating.</h2>
    <p>
      First make sure you are not cheating.<br />If you are a modded host and
      this occured, this is probably because your mod doesnt apply the "+25
      modded protocol". You need to ask to your mod's developer to add the
      protocol or play on our second server(AntiCheat disabled)<br />If you are
      a modded client(non host), then its probably because your mod is sending
      rpc calls that normally won't be sent by a client. First ask to your mod's
      developer. Then report issues to NikoCat233.<br />If above solutions
      doesnt ease the issue, report issues to NikoCat233 and try our second
      region where AntiCheat is completely disabled.
    </p>

    <h2>[Impostor STCM+]</h2>
    <p>LOL</p>

    <h2>Server failed to handle your packet</h2>
    <p>
      This may happen sometimes. Make sure host and clients network is good.<br />If
      it occurs crazily, report issues to NikoCat233
    </p>

    <h2>Vanilla TooManyRequests while matchmaking</h2>
    <p>
      You failed InnerSloth auth for too many times.<br />Try play on InnerSloth
      servers for a while, wait for around 15 minutes and try rejoin our
      server.<br />If it occurs crazily, report issues to NikoCat233
    </p>

    <h2>
      Vanilla "Your communications settings are blocking you from joining the
      game"
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is because you are using a guest account to join our server.<br />Sorry,
      we don't allow that currently.
    </p>

    <h2>Vanilla The AmongUs server cannot Auth you. / Sabotage!</h2>
    <p>
      If you can join InnerSloth Servers, try rejoin.<br />If you keep getting
      this and you believe that this is not your fault, report issues to
      NikoCat233
    </p>

    <h2>Other Errors</h2>
    <p>
      If you meet other errors and you believe its server's fault, report issues
      to NikoCat233
    </p>
