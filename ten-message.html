        <h1>Dear Moe,</h1>
        <p>
            I sincerely apologize for deliberately neglecting my work on the TOHE project recently. I want to clarify
            that I hold no personal bias against the TEN team or you personally. I neither fully understand nor
            particularly care about the specific issues that have occurred (in fact, almost no one has informed me about
            what problems TEN has encountered during this period and I personally did not try to seek more details).
        </p>
        <p>
            My decision to abandon TOHE maintenance stems from a complete loss of passion for the project. There are two
            primary reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First, Innersloth's anti-cheat measures implemented on their official servers have severely interfered
                with the TOHE mod. The difficulty of maintaining TOHE to adapt to official servers has increased
                exponentially, requiring an ever-increasing amount of my personal time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Second, working on this project no longer provides me with any sense of personal growth or skill
                development. TOHE, like all H-series mods, has reached a state where we're essentially trading workload
                for quality (KARPED1EM, the original founder of TOHE, actually left the project for this very reason).
                There's an overwhelming backlog of issues and feature requests, and completely fixing these
                problems—even addressing urgent ones—requires enormous time investment that amounts to mere engineering
                labor without any substantial development or innovation.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            When Innersloth updated their anti-cheat system and TOHE faced its most critical issues, I was forced to
            prioritize my university final examinations and consequently abandoned TOHE maintenance during that period.
            During this time, I realized I could use these hours for activities I genuinely enjoy. My passion is no
            longer sufficient to sustain my involvement in this project.
        </p>
        <p>
            I apologize, but even with financial compensation, I am no longer willing to work on TOHE. I have completed
            two years of university and am about to enter my third year. In China, educational competition is extremely
            intense, and I need to dedicate more time to preparing for graduate school entrance exams or participating
            in professional skill competitions. Maintaining mod projects no longer enhances these capabilities and has
            become a source of significant stress rather than recreational enjoyment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, I formally request to resign from my position as lead developer of TOHE, transferring this
            responsibility to developers who possess greater passion, capability, and willingness to invest their time
            and energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            I deeply apologize for leaving this mess behind. I will find time to help resolve some related issues when
            possible. In fact, I do not plan to engage in Among Us modding in the future. I will only maintain my
            private Impostor servers, and after miniduikboot introduces account verification to his servers, I will shut
            down the EU server, maintaining only NA and AS until Among Us completely loses its popularity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again, I apologize for my irresponsibility.
